# PHP_PDO_Tutorial
A simple tutorial to help you create a small cms blog using PHP, PDO and MySQL

I always wanted to create a tutorial on how to insert data to a database table, so here it is.

You first must modify the config.php file to set your connection strings in order to get the rest of the files to run properly. Then you must either setup up the database and database table yourself or run the install.php file. Finally the index.php demostrates and informs you how to go about writing the read / write portions of a small CMS. It's my opinion that the code is commented and variables properly named that you should understand how-to-write-read to a MySQL database table. In the future I plan on updating it where one can edit and delete threads that are posted to the database table. 

You must get Swiftmailer on you own. The best thing to do is use composer to install it.
